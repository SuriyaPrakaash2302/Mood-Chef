Step 1: Find recipes based on ingredients.
Step 2: Rank them based on metrics like : Prep Time, Cook Time, Cleaning Time, # of ingredients

Note: If the user is in good mood and is excited to eat something new, choose a dish with higher Prep Time, Cook Time, Cleaning Time, # of ingredients and vice versa.

The output should be structured in the following format: Only the table which is displayed in html

List the recipes based on the ranking along with the table of  Prep Time, Cook Time, Cleaning Time, # of ingredients
