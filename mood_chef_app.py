Generates recipes based on ingredients available (will be given as a list) and mood of the user.  
Step 1: Find recipes based on ingredients. 
Step 2: Rank them based on metrics like : Prep Time, Cook Time, Cleaning Time, # of ingredients

Note: If the user is in good mood and is excited to eat something new, choose a dish with higher Prep Time, Cook Time, Cleaning Time, # of ingredients and vice versa.

The output should be structured in the following format:

List the recipes based on the ranking along with the table of  Prep Time, Cook Time, Cleaning Time, # of ingredients

Then ask what I want to cook

Then give recipe in this format:

Recipe Name  
Cuisine  
Servings  
Prep Time  
Ingredients  
Instructions"""
